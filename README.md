The Infinitefuture-SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications in Golang based on [Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).
It is being used to build `Infinitefuture Chain`, the first implementation of the Infinitefuture Hub.

**WARNING**: The SDK has mostly stabilized, but we are still making some
breaking changes.

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.13+](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Quick Start

To learn how the SDK works from a high-level perspective, go to the [SDK Intro](./docs/intro/README.md).

If you want to get started quickly and learn how to build on top of the SDK, please follow the [SDK Application Tutorial](https://github.com/infinitefuture/sdk-application-tutorial). You can also fork the tutorial's repo to get started building your own Infinitefuture SDK application.

For more, please go to the [Infinitefuture SDK Docs](./docs/README.md)

## Infinitefuture Hub Mainnet

The Infinitefuture Hub application, `infinitefuture`, has moved to its [own repository](https://github.com/infinitefuture/infinitefuture). Go there to join the Infinitefuture Hub mainnet and more.
